## Repository for ChBE202: Advanced Kinetics and Reaction Engineering

This repository was intended for use in the Tufts University ChBE202 graduate-level course on reaction kinetics and reaction engineering. The intent is to access the files within via a Binder-generated JupyterLab environment (or downloaded for access on personal computers).

To generate the environment, click on the button below. This can be done with a computer, tablet, or phone. None of the changes made are permanent, but copies can be downloaded if desired. Also note that the environment will time out after 10 minutes of inactivity; all progress made during this time will be lost if copies are not downloaded.
